# CorgAPI
This is my final project for my Cloud Computing class at Utah State University.

In this project, I built a custom web application from scratch, leveraging AWS cloud resources like EC2, RDS, and Cloud9.

I demonstrate my abilities across the software stack, from database development to web design.

This repository serves almost as an intro to software development. I learned a lot about code reusability, object-oriented design, and package management.

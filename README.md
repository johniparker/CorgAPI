# CorgApp
This is my final project for my Cloud Computing class at Utah State University.

In this project, I built a custom web application from scratch, leveraging AWS cloud resources like EC2, RDS, and Cloud9.

I demonstrate my abilities across the software stack, from database development to web design.

This repository serves as my intro to software development. My key takeaways involve code reusability, object-oriented design, and package management.
